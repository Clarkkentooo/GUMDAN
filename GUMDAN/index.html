                    Become Eivor, a mighty Viking raider and lead your clan from
                    the harsh shores of Norway to a new home amid the lush
                    farmlands of ninth-century England. Explore a beautiful,
                    mysterious open world where you'll face brutal enemies, raid
                    fortresses, build your clan's new settlement, and forge
                    alliances to win glory and earn a place in Valhalla. England
                    in the age of the Vikings is a fractured nation of petty
                    lords and warring kingdoms. Beneath the chaos lies a rich
                    and untamed land waiting for a new conqueror. Will it be
                    you?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lead your people in massive assaults against Saxon armies
                    and fortresses, and expand your influence far beyond your
                    settlement’s borders. Command a crew of raiders and launch
                    lightning-fast surprise attacks from your longship to claim
                    your enemies’ riches for your clan.

                    the world around you while acquiring new skills and gear to
                    suit your playstyle. Blaze your own path across England by
                    fighting brutal battles and leading fiery raids, or form
                    strategic alliances and triumph by your wits. Every choice
                    you make in combat and conversation is another step on the
                    path to greatness.

                    ROCKET LEAGUE SEASON 13 HITS REWIND TO THE TURN OF THE
                    CENTURY!- Tape your Season highlights on VHS. The 90s and
                    early 2000s, a time that was bold, radical, and most
                    importantly: destined to return in Rocket League Season 13!
                    Get ready for reminiscent nights at Mannfield—Season 13
                    kicks off December 6. Here’s the 4-1-1 on this Season’s
                    Rocket Pass Premium. Upon purchase, you’ll auto-unlock the
                    Ace Car Body. Go up the Tiers to unlock other new items like
                    the RC Antenna, CRT Wheels, Primo Car Body, yadda yadda
                    yadda… (That’s right, Season 13’s Rocket Pass Premium has
                    two different Car Bodies!) NOTE: Ace uses the Breakout
                    hitbox, and Primo uses the Hybrid hitbox. The hitboxes for
                    both Car Bodies have been shifted back and lowered for a
                    better visual fit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NEW: CROSS-GAME ITEMS AND TRADE-IN SYSTEM UPDATES-
                    Cross-game ownership has arrived in Rocket League! Any item
                    with the Cross-Game attribute will also appear in your
                    Fortnite Locker if you play Fortnite using the same Epic
                    Games account. The first Car Bodies to get the Cross-Game
                    treatment are Octane, Jäger 619, Cyclone, and the
                    Lamborghini Huracán STO, along with select Decals for each,
                    and the OEM Wheels. The Cross-Game attribute will be added
                    to more items over time, so stay tuned! Cross-Game items are
                    also part of Rocket League’s Trade-In system, so you can
                    trade in eligible Cross-Game items for one item of a higher
                    rarity. Cross-Game items will have some additional trade-in
                    rules—for example, only duplicates of Cross-Game items will
                    appear in the Trade-In Menu until just one instance of the
                    duplicate remains in your inventory. The full list of
                    Cross-Game trade-in rules will be included in the Season 13
                    patch notes, and these added rules will not apply to
                    non-Cross-Game items.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also, if you’ve been sweating it out in Ranked, Season 12
                    Competitive Rewards are in tow too. We’re dropping Goal
                    Explosions for all eligible players, along with in-game
                    Titles for Grand Champion and SSL players!

                    A neon-noir story in a rain-drenched cyberpunk metropolis.
                    It’s your first night on the job working for the Cloudpunk
                    delivery service. Two rules: Don’t miss a delivery and don’t
                    ask what’s in the package.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Your name is Rania. This is your first night working for
                    Cloudpunk, the semi-legal delivery company based in the
                    sprawling city of Nivalis. You go everywhere, from the
                    Marrow below to the spires that pierce the grey clouds high
                    above before scraping the edge of the troposphere. No
                    delivery job is too dangerous, and no one is faster than a
                    Cloudpunk driver.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this story-based exploration game, you will meet a
                    diverse range of characters including androids, AI and
                    unscrupulous humans at every level of society. Everyone has
                    a story, and in the course of one night in Nivalis,
                    everything will change.
                  </p>
